# MovieRecommenderSystem
Release Date : 2-Jan-2023

Predicting ```Movies``` using Tagged Based corpus and cosine similarity metrix. 

Tag-based recommendation: generating better recommendations by incorporating tags into the recommendation process.
Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar the documents are irrespective of their size.
Mathematically, Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.
In this context, the two vectors I am talking about are arrays containing the word counts of two documents.
When plotted on a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a word in the document, the cosine similarity captures the orientation (the angle) of the documents and not the magnitude.
