Predicting ```Movies``` using Tagged Based corpus and cosine similarity matrix. 

Following movie recommender system using cosine similarity matrix is a recommendation algorithm that suggests movies to users based on their past preferences and the similarity between movies' tags. The system calculates the cosine similarity between the user's past movie preferences and all the other movies in the dataset, with the similarity score indicating the degree of similarity between the two movies. A higher cosine similarity score between two movies indicates that the movies have similar tags and are likely to be of interest to the user. The system then uses this cosine similarity matrix to recommend movies to the user that have high similarity scores with the user's past movie preferences.
